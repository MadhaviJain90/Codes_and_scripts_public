### string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single, double or triple quotes. 
# indexing in a string (character numbering) starts from 0

## string slicing ---> a string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the string
# eg. madhavi ---> string length is 7 i.e character 0 till character 6


# concatenation ie addition of strings can be done by + operator
hi = "Guten Tag, "
name = "Madhavi. "
question = "How are you today?"
# c = hi + name 
# print (c)
# or
print (hi + name + question)    # will return Guten Tag, Madhavi. How are you today?
